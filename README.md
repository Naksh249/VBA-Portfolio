# VBA Portfolio

Welcome to my VBA Portfolio!  
This repository showcases a collection of my VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) projects, scripts, and code samples. I use VBA primarily for automating tasks in Microsoft Excel and Access, streamlining workflows, and building custom solutions for data processing and reporting.

## What You'll Find Here

 **Email and Attachment Automation:** Macros that streamline email workflows, such as saving attachments from multiple Outlook emails in one click.
- **Data Import & Reconciliation:** VBA scripts that import, consolidate, and reconcile data from multiple Excel files, including seamless integration with existing Power Query solutions.
- **Data Cleaning Tools:** Utilities to clear, filter, and transform raw datasets for analysis or reporting.
- **Productivity Enhancements:** Macros designed to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency in Excel and Outlook.

Each project is organized in its own folder with sample code, clear documentation, and (where applicable) example files. Feel free to explore the code, try out the macros, or adapt them for your own workflow!
