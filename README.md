# VBA Portfolio

Welcome to my VBA Portfolio!  
This repository showcases a collection of my VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) projects, scripts, and code samples. I use VBA primarily for automating tasks in Microsoft Excel and Access, streamlining workflows, and building custom solutions for data processing and reporting.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Automated Reports:** Examples of macros that generate and format reports automatically.
- **Data Cleaning Tools:** Scripts that clean, transform, and validate large datasets.
- **Custom User Forms:** Interactive forms developed using VBA for improved user experience.
- **Productivity Utilities:** Macros that speed up repetitive office tasks.

Each project includes a folder with sample code, documentation, and (where possible) example files. Feel free to browse the code, try out the macros, or use them as inspiration for your own projects!
