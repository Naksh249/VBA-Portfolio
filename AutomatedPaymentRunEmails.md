# Project: Automated Payment Run Proposal Emails (Excel VBA + Outlook)

## Summary
Developed a VBA tool to generate and send weekly payment run approval emails with attached reports and dynamically populated totals.

## Problem
- Manual process took 20â€“30 minutes weekly.
- Subject line, tables, and notes had to be manually copied from Excel into Outlook.
- High risk of errors (missing values, wrong recipients).

## Solution
VBA button in Excel automates:
- Extracting totals tables.
- Creating Outlook email with dynamic subject line.
- Embedding formatted tables in the body.
- Attaching the payment run report.
- Sending to the correct manager group.

## Impact
- Reduced process time from ~30 minutes to <1 minute.
- Eliminated copy-paste errors.
- Ensured consistent, professional reporting every week.

> ðŸ’¡ **This project ticks so many boxes:** *VBA + Outlook integration, automation of a real finance process, measurable efficiency gain.*
